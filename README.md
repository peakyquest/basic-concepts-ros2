# Basic ROS2 Concepts and Packages

This repository provides a collection of ROS2 packages designed to guide you through the fundamental concepts and development practices in ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2). It includes examples of publisher-subscriber models, service-client communication, custom message types, and the use of launch files.

## Packages in this Repository

### `ros2_basic_python`
This package contains essential examples of ROS2 publisher-subscriber nodes and service-server/client nodes. It also includes launch files for running the scripts, providing a solid foundation for building and deploying ROS2 applications.

### `ros2_basic_msgs`
This package provides custom message (`msg`) and service (`srv`) interface definitions for ROS2. It demonstrates how to create and use these custom interfaces within a ROS2 environment, enabling tailored communication between nodes.
